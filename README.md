# JavascriptCalculator
A small javascript calculator just for my javascritpt project.<br>
The entire project was made before I learn git & github reason why there's no major commit.
You'll notice that there's some npm features, They were added a couple of minutes before commiting(Not when coding the project).
I used esbuild bundler for bundling and minifying the javascipt code. You cand find the official code in the javascript folder.
In fact, that folder just uses modules that i made. So, if you really wanna understand the whole code, Just look at the my_module folder.
Have a nice day!
